## Creating Issues

Use `isq issue create` with problem-framing titles (what's wrong, not the solution).

```
isq issue create --title "Cannot assign issues to goals during creation" --body "**Problem**: ...
**Goal**: ...
**Success criteria**:
- ..."
```

Body format:
- **Problem**: 1-2 sentences
- **Goal**: 1 sentence
- **Success criteria**: bullet list
